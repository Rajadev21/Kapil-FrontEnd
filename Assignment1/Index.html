    <h1>Raja Bomma</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Raja. I graduated from Chandigarh University in 2023 with a degree in Computer Science Engineering. I have strong technical skills in Java backend development, including expertise in JDBC, J2EE, Servlets, Hibernate, MVC, and various Spring modules such as Spring Core.
        
        In addition to my backend skills, I have also gained proficiency in frontend development and have a solid understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java.
        
        Recently, I developed and deployed a project called "Smart Contact Manager." This application enables users to register and perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage their contacts efficiently. I utilized multiple Spring modules to complete this project successfully.
